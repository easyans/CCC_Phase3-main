There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line.
Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x − 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
Input Format
First line contains the integer N. Next line contains N integers, the position of the mice.
Third line contains N integers, the position of the holes.
Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
Output Format
Output one number corresponding to the minimum number of minutes it will take for the last mice to go into the hole.

//PROGRAM for the above question in  🐍Python language :
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
b.sort()
 
res = 0
for i in range(n):
  if abs(a[i] - b[i]) > res: res = abs(a[i] - b[i])
print(res)
